### Hello!
My name is Lori Ann Avila, however, Cube has been a pseudonym the I have been using online for quite a few years.
I'm currently an undergraduate student at CSUF majoring in Latin American Studies and Computer Engineering.
I am currently working on finishing up a project creating my own portable monitor for my laptop to have a second screen, 
  as well as working on starting a remote controled skateboard project by first researching the components needed then deciding if 
  fixing a broken board or resourcing each part separately is the way to get to my end goal.
I am also starting to learn C++ and python through course classes and online classes.
