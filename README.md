### Hello!
My name is Lori Ann Avila, however, Cube has been a pseudonym that I have been using online for quite a few years. I am currently an undergraduate student at CSUF majoring in Latin American Studies and Computer Engineering, with a minor in Spanish.

I am currently working on finishing up a project creating my own portable monitor for my laptop to have a second screen, as well as working on starting a remote controled skateboard project by first researching the components needed then deciding if fixing a broken board or resourcing each part separately is the way to get to my end goal.

I am also starting to learn C++ and python through course classes and online classes. As well as bash through my dual boot system which has Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10.

Through my Computer Engineering major and my positions in clubs, Engineering Design club and IEEE, I have been able to learn CAD tools such as Solidworks 2021, 3D printing, Altium, and more.
