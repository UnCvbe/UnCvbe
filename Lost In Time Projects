USB Chassis
  Started this project as a beginner project for my solidwork skills. Not very well documented. Worked on 6-8 iterations of the chassis.
  Stopped working on the chassis with only the outside design left to do as well as figuring out the best way to keep it together other than super glue.

Portable Monitor
  Started this project to start using both electrical skills with the solidworks skills I had recently learned onto a singular project.
  Stopped working on the project once I got the correct measurments for the bezel for the display however haven;t been able to continue due to the Spring 2022 semester
  ending right at the end of the project.
